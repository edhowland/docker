Ruby+Gems.txt - explains the current Ruby and Rubygems setup needed for this toy docker.

Ruby on this host id installed by 'ruby-install' in /opt/rubies
```
     ruby-install --system ruby 2.2.2
```

## Gems and Bundler
Gems are installed with Bundler in the Gemfile in this directory. Use the folloing commands to get started:
```
  sudo gem install  bundler
  bundle install
```

## Logging:
 The Rakefile make use the log() method. This is suplied by the 'logging' gem:

The rake module can be found in ./lib/tasks/log.rake

After running rake tasks, 'rake.log' will exist in the same dir as Rakefile.

Versions of Ruby
This toy Docker example can be run with any version of Ruby from 1.9+ Currently, pdfocr uses 1.9.3 from apt-get. The host Ruby is 2.2. but apt-get 1.9.3 would work as well
== ruby-install and chruby
On Digital Ocean and Vagrant VMs, I am using 'install-ruby --system ruby 2.2.2' which installs ruby in /opt/rubies
