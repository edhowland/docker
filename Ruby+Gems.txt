## Running Specs
The lib/specs dir contains all the minitest specs so far. To run all
of them do:
```
    cd ./lib/specs
    rake test
````

The Rakefile there contains a special TestTask labeled :test which compiles all the
specs matching the pattern *_spec.rb into a unigied test run and report.
The files it currently tests are in ./lib/container.
