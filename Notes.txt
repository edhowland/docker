edhowland- first attemp to launch pdftk container within Ruby. Using ruby 2.2.2 
       Also thought to use Rake to compile the docker images from 2 Dockerfile . The file ;.done' in pdftk/ and pdfocr/ indicates the build state of the images.
edhowland - ### Rakefile
	If Ruby is installed, run 'rake' in docker root dir to build docker images pdftk and pdfocr from scratch.
	So far this file does not actually run sudo docker build yet
